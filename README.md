A snake game using Pi and a adafruit 32x32 matrix

The code have comments in french as i speak french and this was mainly a small project for myself. It uses a matrix sold on Adafruit 32x32 matrix such as this one : https://www.adafruit.com/product/2026. It also uses an HAT that came with the matrix.
